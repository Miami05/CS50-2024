Characterizing the Audio Aura:
    Combining these averages provides an insight into the listenerâ€™s predominant moods and energy levels.
    For instance, a listener with high energy, valence, and danceability might have an energetic and cheerful audio aura.

Limitations and Improvements:
   A few extreme values can distort the overall picture.
   For example, a single very highenergy song could skew the average energy level.
   Improvement: To get a more representative aura, consider using weighted averages based on listening frequency,
   include temporal variations (e.g., changes in mood over months), and analyze song lyrics and themes for deeper insights.
